# Part 2
All the analysis for this part was performed with jupyter notebooks, `privacy_evaluation.ipynb` and `defence.ipynb` and depend on the provided `grid.py` and csv data files.

##other files
`queries_mec.csv` contains the `queries.csv` data after having applied the defence mecanism, i.e. replacing `lat` and `lon` by the cell ID.

##dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib

##notes
The notebooks were saved after being run, then all the informations should be there. However, they must be reproducible and can be run again.
